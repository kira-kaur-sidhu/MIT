# Exercise A:
def uniquify(data):
    """
    Given a list of integers or strings, return a new list with the same
    set of items in the same order, but keeping only the first occurrence of
    each item.

    Example: uniquify([1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 9, 10]) == [1, 9, 5, 3, 2, 10]

# Exercise B:
def how_old(data):
    """
    Given a list of integers or strings, returns a list of the same length
    where the ith entry is the distance of the ith entry in the input list
    to the last occurrence of the same value in the input list,
    or None if there was no previous occurrence.

    Example: how_old([1,2,1,1,2]) == [None, None, 2, 1, 3]
