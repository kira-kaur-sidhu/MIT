## How I Grade Myself ##
Information on scoring I have is that the score on each lab will be based on a combination of the conceptual questions answered via the lab's page on the web site, as well as performance against test cases run on the server and passing basic good style and maximum complexity requirements. I do not have access to the MIT submit script, so I base my lab score on pylint good style ratings and passing all tests.

For the midterm and final I will be using one of the practice tests and timing myself and then comparing against one of the included answers.

Of course I am doing this for my own knowledge and fun and my grade in no way reflects the difficulty of this course taken by actual MIT students
