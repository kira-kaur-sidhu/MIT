# Class exercise: write a helper function to convert from kernel as
# matrix in list-of-list format (which is easier to visualize), to the
# dictionary format:

def make_kernel_dict(kernel_matrix):
    """ 
    Given a kernel in matrix (list of list) format,
    return a kernel in dictionary format.

    """
    pass
